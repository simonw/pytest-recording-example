# pytest-recording-example 

I use this repo to figure out patterns to use with [pytest-recording](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-recording/).

See:

- [Initial set of tests](https://github.com/simonw/pytest-recording-example/issues/1) for details on basic setup, to work with `urllib` and `httpx` and `requests`
- [Figure out pattern for recording authenticated API calls](https://github.com/simonw/pytest-recording-example/issues/2) for an example against the Claude 3 authenticated JSON API
